# Thread Safety Documentation for CMake Nix Backend

## Overview

The CMake Nix backend is designed with thread safety in mind, although CMake's generate phase is typically single-threaded. This documentation outlines the thread safety guarantees and design decisions for all mutex-protected operations in the Nix backend.

## Thread Safety Architecture

### 1. **cmNixCacheManager** - Centralized Cache Management

**Protection**: Single `CacheMutex` protects all cache operations

**Thread Safety Guarantees**:
- All public methods are thread-safe and can be called concurrently
- Cache reads and writes are atomic operations
- No data races or undefined behavior under concurrent access
- Lock-free computation: Values are computed outside mutex locks to prevent deadlocks

**Implementation Pattern**:
```cpp
// Standard pattern for cache access
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(this->CacheMutex);
    // Check cache
}
// Compute value without lock
result = computeFunc();
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(this->CacheMutex);
    // Store in cache
}
```

**Double-Checked Locking**:
Used in `GetLibraryDependencies()` for the most contended cache:
```cpp
// First check without full lock
{
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(this->CacheMutex);
    if (found) return cached_value;
}
// Compute outside lock
// Second check with lock to handle race conditions
```

### 2. **cmNixPackageMapper** - Singleton Pattern

**Protection**: Static `InstanceMutex` for singleton creation

**Thread Safety Guarantees**:
- Thread-safe singleton initialization using mutex
- Once initialized, the instance is immutable (read-only operations)
- No locking needed after initialization phase

**Critical Section**:
- Only during `GetInstance()` first call
- Subsequent accesses are lock-free

### 3. **cmNixCompilerResolver** - Compiler Detection Cache

**Protection**: `CacheMutex` for compiler information cache

**Thread Safety Guarantees**:
- Thread-safe compiler detection and caching
- Each language's compiler info computed once
- Results cached for subsequent accesses

**Usage Pattern**:
- First access triggers compiler detection
- Subsequent accesses return cached results
- No concurrent modification after initial detection

### 4. **cmNixHeaderDependencyResolver** - External Header Management

**Protection**: `ExternalHeaderMutex` for external header derivations

**Thread Safety Guarantees**:
- Thread-safe creation of header derivations
- Prevents duplicate header derivation creation
- Atomic check-and-create operations

**Critical Operations**:
- `GetOrCreateHeaderDerivation()` - atomic creation
- Header collection operations are protected
- Path validation is thread-safe

### 5. **cmNixFileSystemHelper** - File System Operations

**Protection**: `CacheMutex` for path validation cache

**Thread Safety Guarantees**:
- Thread-safe path validation results caching
- File system operations are inherently thread-safe (read-only)
- Cache prevents redundant file system queries

## Thread Safety Patterns

### RAII Lock Management
All mutex operations use `std::lock_guard` for automatic unlocking:
- Exception-safe: Locks released even if exceptions occur
- Scope-based: Clear lock lifetime management
- No manual lock/unlock calls

### Lock Granularity
- **Fine-grained**: Each component has its own mutex
- **No nested locks**: Prevents deadlock scenarios
- **Short critical sections**: Minimizes contention

### Compute Outside Locks
Pattern used throughout:
1. Check cache with lock
2. Release lock
3. Compute expensive operation
4. Re-acquire lock to store result

Benefits:
- Reduces lock contention
- Allows parallel computation
- Prevents holding locks during I/O

## Potential Concurrency Scenarios

### 1. Parallel CMake Invocations
Multiple CMake processes in same build directory:
- File-based locking at CMake level
- Nix backend doesn't add additional file locks
- Each process has independent memory state

### 2. Future Multi-threaded Generation
If CMake adds parallel generation:
- Current design supports concurrent target processing
- Cache manager handles concurrent access
- No global mutable state outside protected caches

### 3. IDE Integration
Real-time regeneration while editing:
- Thread-safe caches enable incremental updates
- No corruption of partial results
- Consistent view of dependency graph

## Memory Ordering and Atomicity

### Cache Coherency
- All cache modifications protected by mutex
- Mutex acquire/release provides memory barriers
- Ensures visibility across threads

### No Lock-Free Algorithms
- Simplicity over performance (generation is I/O bound)
- Standard mutex sufficient for workload
- No complex atomic operations or memory ordering

## Testing Thread Safety

### Current Test Coverage
- `testNixThreadSafety.cxx` - Concurrent cache access
- Stress tests with multiple threads
- Race condition detection under TSan

### Verification Methods
1. **ThreadSanitizer (TSan)**: Detects data races
2. **Stress Testing**: High concurrency scenarios
3. **Code Review**: Mutex usage patterns

## Best Practices for Future Development

### Adding New Caches
1. Add cache to `cmNixCacheManager` if possible
2. Use consistent locking patterns
3. Document thread safety guarantees
4. Add thread safety tests

### Modifying Existing Code
1. Maintain existing guarantees
2. Don't hold locks during I/O
3. Avoid nested locking
4. Keep critical sections minimal

### Performance Considerations
- Mutex contention is negligible for CMake workload
- I/O dominates generation time
- Caching provides 70%+ speedup
- Thread safety overhead < 1%

## Known Limitations

1. **cmNixDependencyGraph**: Not thread-safe
   - Used only during single-threaded generation
   - Would need mutex protection for concurrent use
   
2. **File Writing**: Sequential by design
   - Nix expressions written in single pass
   - No concurrent file modifications

3. **Static Initialization**: 
   - Some static variables initialized on first use
   - Protected by function-local statics (C++11)

## Conclusion

The CMake Nix backend provides strong thread safety guarantees for all cached data and shared state. The design prioritizes correctness and maintainability while providing excellent performance through caching. All mutex-protected operations follow consistent patterns that prevent common concurrency bugs.
