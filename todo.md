- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Well-documented with examples and best practices

## Code Quality Issues from Architecture Review (2025-07-28)

### Architecture Issues (MPED Architect Review):
1. **God Class Anti-Pattern**:
   - `cmGlobalNixGenerator` is over 4,500 lines doing too many things
   - Should be decomposed into focused modules (derivation writer, dependency resolver, etc.)
   - Mixed abstraction levels throughout
   
   **Refactoring Task Breakdown**:
   a) DONE Extract derivation writing functionality from cmGlobalNixGenerator into separate cmNixDerivationWriter class
      - DONE Create cmNixDerivationWriter class with clean interface
      - DONE Move WriteNixHelperFunctions, WriteFilesetUnion, WriteCompositeSource methods
      - DONE Refactor WriteObjectDerivation to use the new class (partial delegation)
      - DONE Refactor WriteLinkDerivation to use the new class  
      - DONE Refactor WriteCustomCommandDerivations (already properly delegated to cmNixCustomCommandGenerator)
   
   b) DONE Extract dependency graph management from cmGlobalNixGenerator into cmNixDependencyGraph class
      - DONE Move BuildDependencyGraph method and DependencyGraph nested class
      - DONE Move ObjectDerivations map and related dependency tracking  
      - DONE Implement proper graph algorithms in isolated component
   
   c) DONE Extract custom command handling from cmGlobalNixGenerator into cmNixCustomCommandHandler class
      - DONE Move CustomCommandInfo struct and CustomCommands vector
      - DONE Move WriteCustomCommandDerivations and CollectCustomCommands methods
      - DONE Move custom command cycle detection logic (300+ lines)
   
   d) DONE Extract install rule generation from cmGlobalNixGenerator into cmNixInstallRuleGenerator class
      - DONE Move WriteInstallRules, WriteInstallOutputs, CollectInstallTargets methods
      - DONE Move InstallTargets vector and related state
      - DONE Create focused install handling component
   
   e) DONE Extract header dependency processing from cmGlobalNixGenerator into cmNixHeaderDependencyResolver class
      - DONE Move ProcessHeaderDependencies, FilterProjectHeaders methods
      - DONE Move ExternalHeaderDerivations map and GetOrCreateHeaderDerivation
      - DONE Consolidate header scanning logic
   
   f) DONE Create cmNixCacheManager to consolidate all caching logic
      - DONE Move DerivationNameCache, LibraryDependencyCache, TransitiveDependencyCache
      - DONE Implement clear cache invalidation strategies
      - DONE Add proper memory limits and eviction policies
   
   g) DONE Move compiler detection and configuration logic to enhanced cmNixCompilerResolver
      - DONE Move DetermineCompilerPackage to cmNixCompilerResolver
      - DONE GetCompilerPackage and GetCompilerCommand already delegating to resolver
      - DONE Consolidate compiler-specific logic in one place
   
   h) DONE Create cmNixBuildConfiguration class to handle build config logic
      - DONE Move GetBuildConfiguration method
      - DONE Add configuration-specific flag generation methods
      - DONE Separate build configuration concerns
   
   i) DONE Extract file system operations into cmNixFileSystemHelper
      - DONE Move IsSystemPath to cmNixFileSystemHelper
      - DONE Add path validation logic and security checks
      - DONE Consolidate file system operations with proper error handling
   
   j) DONE Create integration tests for the refactored components
      - DONE Test each extracted component in isolation
      - DONE Test component interactions
      - DONE Ensure no regression in functionality

2. **State Management Problems**:
   - Multiple mutex-protected caches with unclear ownership
   - State duplicated between different tracking structures
   - Should consolidate into single source of truth

3. **MPED Principle Violations**:
   - DONE Fixed silent failures in error handling - added fail-fast error reporting to `cmNixPackageMapper::LoadMappingsFromFile`

### Test Coverage Gaps (Scout Testing Advocate Review):
1. **Missing Critical Tests**:
   - DONE Added integration tests for refactored components
   - DONE Added tests for error handling and recovery scenarios
   - DONE Added tests for concurrent/parallel build scenarios
   - No property-based testing for input validation (low priority)

2. **Security-Critical Path Testing**:
   - DONE `ValidatePathSecurity()` - tested in testNixSecurityPaths
   - DONE Symlink resolution and circular symlink handling - tested
   - DONE Path traversal attack prevention - comprehensive tests added
   - DONE Unicode normalization in paths - tested with dangerous patterns

3. **Thread Safety Testing**:
   - DONE Concurrent access to singleton - tested with multiple threads
   - DONE Race conditions in cache access - tested with concurrent operations
   - DONE Parallel operations - tested with thread safety tests

### Maintainability Issues (Keeper Maintainer Review):
1. **Monolithic Implementation**:
   - DONE Reduced main file size by extracting 7 major components
   - DONE Complex dependency graph extracted to cmNixDependencyGraph class
   - DONE Custom command cycle detection moved to cmNixCustomCommandHandler

2. **Technical Debt**:
   - DONE `CMAKE_NIX_IGNORE_CIRCULAR_DEPS` flag is dangerous workaround - REMOVED (was never actually implemented)
   - Configuration-time file embedding could hit Nix expression limits
   - Hard-coded Unix conventions throughout

3. **Documentation Gaps**:
   - Missing architectural documentation for dependency graph algorithm
   - Caching strategy not documented
   - Thread safety guarantees unclear
   - Performance characteristics undocumented

### Domain Clarity Issues (Compass Domain Expert Review):
1. **Mixed Domain Concerns**:
   - CMake and Nix concepts not clearly separated
   - `cmGlobalNixGenerator` handles both CMake processing AND Nix generation
   - Path handling mixes CMake resolution with Nix store concepts

2. **Poor Business Language**:
   - Technical terms used without business context
   - Method names like `WriteObjectDerivation` don't express intent
   - Constants mix technical and domain concepts

3. **Scattered Business Rules**:
   - Compiler selection logic buried in string comparisons
   - Build configuration rules mixed with file I/O
   - Dependency resolution combines multiple concerns

### Tooling Enhancement Opportunities (Forge Tooling Expert Review):
1. **Development Environment**:
   - shell.nix missing modern tools (ccache, profilers, static analyzers)
   - No pre-commit hooks configured
   - Missing development helpers and aliases

2. **Build Automation**:
   - justfile could use format, lint-fix, watch commands
   - No automated benchmarking or profiling
   - Missing code coverage generation

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - No .envrc for direnv users
   - Missing IDE configuration files
   - Incomplete developer documentation

### Recommended Refactoring Priority:
1. **High Priority**:
   - Extract dependency graph into separate component
   - Add security-critical path validation tests
   - Document critical algorithms and caching strategy

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Decompose cmGlobalNixGenerator into focused modules
   - Add thread safety and concurrency tests
   - Create explicit domain boundaries between CMake and Nix

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Enhance development tooling
   - Add property-based testing
   - Improve error messages with context
