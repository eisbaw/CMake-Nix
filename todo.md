DONE: Fix this: The Nix generator doesn't support $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:...> expressions yet

DONE: Look for other unsupported features in Nix generator. (See UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES.md)

DONE: Look for code smells in the cmake Nix generator. (See CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md)

DONE: Look for assumptions in the cmake Nix generator. (See CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md)

Improve the cmake Nix generator.

DONE: Fix what is reported in UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES.md - OBJECT library support fixed

DONE: Fix what is reported in CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md - Code refactored with helper methods, platform abstraction added

DONE: Check for uncomitted files. Consider if they should be added. Test cases should be added to justfile and follow pattern to the other test cases. - Added test_compile_language_expr and test_interface_library

DONE: Search the web for cmake C/C++ open-source projects. Add a medium-sized popular cmake-based project as a new test case. Use cmake nix generator backend to build it. - Added test_json_library as a comprehensive medium-sized project test

Self-host cmake: adapt bootstrap so we can build cmake with Nix generator.
