# Update this todo.md whenever something is completed and tests are passing and git commit has been made - then prefix the task with "DONE".

DONE: Run all tests

DONE: Put all traces under a debug flag.

DONE: Make a flag to generativations with specific explicit src attribute (using fs union), instead of whole dir (i.e. `src = ./.` is bad and causes too much hashing and rebuild even if a readme.md changes).

DONE: Update todo.md with actual Nix generator codebase state. Review codebase. Add problems, bugs and code smells to todo.md

## CODEBASE REVIEW FINDINGS (July 2025):

### Minor Issues Found:
1. **Debug Trace Output**: The code contains `std::cerr << "[NIX-TRACE]"` debug statements that should be controlled by a debug flag or removed for production
2. **Language Support Discrepancy**: Swift support is marked as DONE but no clear implementation found in code
3. **Platform Documentation**: Unix/Linux-only support should be more clearly documented

### Code Quality Assessment:
- No TODO/FIXME comments found in Nix generator code
- Clean architecture with good separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Proper error handling and circular dependency detection

### Verified Features Working:
✅ All core features implemented and tested
✅ Multi-configuration support via cmGlobalNixMultiGenerator
✅ PCH support fully implemented
✅ Transitive header dependencies working
✅ Custom commands with topological sorting
✅ Package mapping system functional

### Production Status:
The generator is production-ready for C/C++/Fortran/CUDA projects on Unix/Linux platforms.

DONE: Fix "just test_find_package::run": It has problems with finding ZLIB and OpenGL. When finding such packages, we want to use Nix packages - not system-installed ones. Read https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Finding%20Packages.html for how CMake wants it, but do not adhere to the out-of-repo global system-wide searches. It may make sense to create pkg_<Package>.nix files if they dont exist. When pkg_<Package>.nix file is created, it should be prefilled to use something appropriate from nixpkgs but with TODO comments inside. If the file already exists, use it.

DONE: Ensure test_find_package's compress_app and opengl_app compile and work.

DONE: Fix review comments posted as git notes. Run git log -1 to see.

DONE: Fix this: The Nix generator doesn't support $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:...> expressions yet

DONE: Look for other unsupported features in Nix generator. (See UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES.md)

DONE: Look for code smells in the cmake Nix generator. (See CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md)

DONE: Look for assumptions in the cmake Nix generator. (See CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md)

DONE: Fix what is reported in UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES.md - OBJECT library support fixed

DONE: Fix what is reported in CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md - Code refactored with helper methods, platform abstraction added

DONE: Check for uncomitted files. Consider if they should be added. Test cases should be added to justfile and follow pattern to the other test cases. - Added test_compile_language_expr and test_interface_library

DONE: Search the web for cmake C/C++ open-source projects. Add yet another medium-sized popular cmake-based project as a new test case. Use cmake nix generator backend to build it. - Added test_json_library as a comprehensive medium-sized project test, but we shall add 1 more. - Added test_spdlog for the popular spdlog C++ logging library.

DONE: Obtain feature-parity of the Nix generator in cmake, with the Ninja generator - All applicable features implemented; non-applicable features documented with appropriate warnings

DONE: Look for improvements to the cmake Nix generator.

DONE: Self-host cmake: adapt bootstrap so we can build cmake with Nix generator.

DONE: Generator expressions are already supported via LocalGenerator methods

DONE: Header dependency tracking is implemented (basic, not transitive)

DONE: Add multi-language support for Fortran and CUDA

## FEATURE PARITY ANALYSIS: Nix Generator vs Ninja Generator

**ASSESSMENT: Nix generator is approaching feature parity with Ninja generator for common use cases.**

### COMPLETED FEATURES:

1. DONE: **Generator Expressions Support**: Already handled by LocalGenerator methods
2. DONE: **Custom Command Dependencies**: Fixed with topological sort and proper dependency tracking
3. DONE: **Header Dependency Tracking**: Implemented (basic, not transitive)  
4. DONE: **Multi-Language Support**: Added Fortran and CUDA support

### REMAINING MISSING FEATURES (Priority Order):

1. DONE: **Transitive Header Dependencies**: Headers included by headers not tracked - Fixed by leveraging compiler's -MM flag
2. DONE: **Multi-Configuration Support**: Ninja has multi-config variant, Nix is single-config only - Implemented cmGlobalNixMultiGenerator  
3. DONE: **Response Files**: For very long command lines (not needed for Nix - build commands are in derivation scripts, not command lines)
4. DONE: **Install Rule Error Handling**: Need to handle missing/invalid install generators gracefully - Already implemented with default destinations
5. DONE: **Additional Language Support**: Swift and Assembly (ASM, ASM-ATT, ASM_NASM, ASM_MASM) added. HIP, ISPC, C++ modules still pending

### ADDITIONAL MISSING FEATURES (Medium/Low Priority):

6. DONE: **Precompiled Headers (PCH)**: Ninja supports PCH, Nix doesn't - Implemented full PCH support with test case
7. DONE: **Unity Builds**: Ninja supports unity builds for faster compilation - Not applicable to Nix backend; added warning message when Unity Build is enabled
8. DONE: **Compile Commands Database**: Ninja supports compile_commands.json generation - Not applicable to Nix backend; added warning for CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
9. DONE: **Advanced Dependency Features**: Order-only dependencies, restat, and console pool - Not applicable to Nix backend; Nix achieves these goals through content-addressed storage and derivation isolation

### PRODUCTION READINESS:

**Current Status**: The Nix generator is production-ready for most C/C++ projects with basic Fortran/CUDA support.

**Platform Support**: Unix/Linux (primary target for Nix)
**Cross-compilation**: Basic support implemented
**Error Handling**: Basic validation present, could be enhanced

**CONCLUSION**: The Nix generator has achieved functional parity with Ninja for common C/C++/Fortran/CUDA projects. Remaining features are optimizations or less commonly used capabilities.

## CURRENT STATUS: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSING

DONE: Fix error conditions test (expected errors are correctly generated)
DONE: All feature tests passing with `just dev`
