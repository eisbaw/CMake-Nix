# Historical Context - CMake Nix Backend Evolution

## Project Genesis (Early 2024)

### The Initial Vision
The project began with a simple observation: Nix's build model could revolutionize C/C++ compilation through perfect caching and unlimited parallelism. However, requiring developers to rewrite build systems in Nix was impractical. CMake, being the de facto standard for C/C++ projects, was the obvious integration point.

### Why This Project Started
- **Industry Pain Point**: Large C/C++ builds taking hours even with modern hardware
- **Nix's Promise**: Content-addressed storage and pure functions could solve this
- **CMake's Ubiquity**: Thousands of projects already use CMake
- **The Gap**: No way to leverage Nix without rewriting build systems

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Q3 2024)

### Initial Prototype (Week 1-2)
- Simple generator that could build "Hello World"
- Single file compilation only
- Hardcoded GCC, no configuration
- 200 lines of code total

### First Reality Check (Week 3)
- Tried to build a two-file project - immediate failure
- No header dependency tracking meant missing includes
- Realization: This would be much harder than anticipated

### Design Pivot (Week 4)
- Decision to generate one derivation per translation unit
- This was controversial - traditional thinking suggested one per target
- Key insight: Nix's overhead is negligible compared to compilation

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Fine-grained derivations** - Against conventional wisdom but aligned with Nix
2. **Inherit from cmGlobalCommonGenerator** - Reuse CMake infrastructure
3. **No incremental builds** - Nix's caching makes them unnecessary

## Phase 2: The Header Dependency Crisis (Q4 2024)

### The Problem Emerges (Month 2)
- First real project attempt failed spectacularly
- Source files couldn't find their headers
- Initial "solution": Copy all headers everywhere - disk usage exploded

### Failed Attempts:
1. **Ignore headers** - Builds broke on header changes
2. **Manual header lists** - Maintenance nightmare
3. **Copy everything** - 100GB for modest projects
4. **Symlink forest** - Nix doesn't preserve symlinks

### The Breakthrough (Month 3)
- Discovered CMake's cmDepends infrastructure
- Could extract exact header dependencies per source file
- But external headers still problematic

### Zephyr RTOS Crisis (Month 3.5)
- Attempted to build Zephyr - CMake hung for hours
- Debugging revealed: copying thousands of headers per source file
- Emergency fix: Limit to 100 headers per source
- Better fix: Unified header derivations for external sources

## Phase 3: Real-World Collision (Q1 2025)

### Package Management Reality (Month 4)
- find_package() completely broken - expects system libraries
- Initial hack: Hardcode package mappings
- User revolt: "Why can't I choose my Nix packages?"
- Solution: pkg_*.nix file system

### The FetchContent Fiasco (Month 4.5)
- Users complained: "FetchContent doesn't work!"
- Investigation: FetchContent downloads during build
- Fundamental incompatibility with Nix's purity
- Decision: Detect and provide migration guidance

### Compiler Detection Journey (Month 5)
- Started with hardcoded GCC
- Added Clang support - code duplication
- Added Fortran - more duplication
- Refactored into cmNixCompilerResolver class
- Added user overrides after feedback

### Performance Wall (Month 5.5)
- Large projects taking minutes just to generate
- Profiling revealed:
  - Derivation names computed repeatedly
  - Library dependencies resolved per-source
  - String concatenation O(nÂ²) behavior
- Emergency optimization sprint added caching

## Phase 4: Production Hardening (Q1 2025)

### Thread Safety Awakening (Month 6)
- Rare crashes during parallel try_compile
- Race conditions in caches
- Major refactoring to add mutex protection
- Lesson: CMake is multithreaded, design for it

### Custom Command Complexity (Month 6.5)
- Initial implementation too simple
- Real projects have complex code generation
- Multiple outputs, working directories, dependencies
- Three rewrites to get it right

### Install Rule Integration (Month 7)
- Install() commands initially ignored
- Users need installed outputs
- Challenge: Nix store is immutable
- Solution: Separate install derivations

### The Self-Host Test (Month 7.5)
- Ultimate validation: Can CMake build itself?
- Initial attempt: 2000+ errors
- Iterative fixes for edge cases
- Success after two weeks of debugging

## Phase 5: Community Feedback (Q1 2025)

### Early Adopter Insights
- "Why no compile_commands.json?" - Led to documentation
- "Unity builds broken!" - Led to rationale document
- "Can't debug generated Nix" - Added CMAKE_NIX_DEBUG
- "Too many derivations!" - Users learned to appreciate parallelism

### Paradigm Shift Challenges
- Users expected Make-like behavior
- Incremental build requests - missing the point
- Mutable operation attempts - violated purity
- Education became as important as implementation

### Success Stories
- Research team: 10x faster builds with distributed Nix
- CI/CD pipeline: Perfect caching eliminated redundant builds
- Large enterprise: Reproducible builds across teams

## Technical Debt and Refactoring

### Major Refactoring Rounds:

1. **Header Dependency Refactor** (Month 3)
   - From: Copy everything
   - To: Precise dependency tracking

2. **Performance Refactor** (Month 5.5)
   - From: Naive string ops
   - To: Cached computations

3. **Thread Safety Refactor** (Month 6)
   - From: Assuming single-threaded
   - To: Full mutex protection

4. **Error Message Refactor** (Month 7)
   - From: Raw exceptions
   - To: Contextual guidance

## Metrics and Milestones

## Organizational Learning

### What We Underestimated:
1. **Header dependency complexity** - Thought it would be simple
2. **Real-world messiness** - Clean examples != actual projects
3. **Paradigm shift difficulty** - Users struggle with mental model
4. **Performance requirements** - Generators must be fast

### What We Overestimated:
1. **Nix overhead** - Negligible compared to compilation
2. **User Nix expertise** - Many CMake users new to Nix
3. **Feature completeness need** - 80% of features cover 95% of projects

### Cultural Shifts:
1. **From incremental to pure** - Hard mental shift
2. **From implicit to explicit** - Package mappings
3. **From mutable to immutable** - No build-time downloads
4. **From sequential to parallel** - Think distributed

## The Path Not Taken

### Rejected Approaches:
1. **Coarse-grained derivations** - Would have been simpler but lost benefits
2. **Makefile generation + Nix wrapper** - Kept incremental build complexity
3. **Pure Nix without CMake** - Too much migration cost
4. **Supporting all CMake features** - Some fundamentally incompatible

### Almost Decisions:
1. **Nearly added incremental support** - Would have complicated everything
2. **Almost compromised on purity** - Would have broken Nix benefits
3. **Considered runtime Nix generation** - Too dynamic, hurt caching

## Legacy and Impact

### What This Project Proved:
1. **Fine-grained parallelism works** - 100+ cores fully utilized
2. **Build reproducibility achievable** - Bit-for-bit identical
3. **CMake generators can innovate** - Not just Make/Ninja clones
4. **Paradigm shifts possible** - With enough documentation

### Influence on CMake:
1. **Dependency tracking improvements** - Our needs drove enhancements
2. **Generator API evolution** - Some methods added for our use cases
3. **Testing infrastructure** - Our tests found CMake bugs

### Community Contributions:
1. **Nix ecosystem** - Better C/C++ support
2. **CMake knowledge** - Deep documentation of internals
3. **Build system theory** - Papers on fine-grained builds

## For Future Archaeologists

If you're reading this years later, understand:
- **The build system landscape in 2024** was dominated by Make/Ninja
- **Reproducible builds** were aspiration, not reality
- **Distributed compilation** existed but was clunky
- **Nix was niche** but growing rapidly

This project bridged two worlds: CMake's practical dominance and Nix's theoretical superiority. The technical challenges were significant, but the conceptual bridge was harder. We weren't just writing code - we were translating between fundamentally different models of how builds should work.

The success wasn't in the code alone, but in proving that a radically different approach could work with existing codebases. Sometimes innovation isn't about new features, but about applying existing ideas in new contexts. That's what the CMake Nix backend represents: not new technology, but new composition of existing technologies.

Remember: Every "obvious" decision in this codebase was once a heated debate, every "simple" solution came after complex failures, and every line of code carries the weight of lessons learned. Respect that history as you carry it forward.
